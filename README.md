SQL ALchemy Challenge

Contributor: Gabriela Delgado

Overview

This project was meant to look at different CSV files to look at the precipitation and temperature data in Hawaii by using SQL Alchemy and graph it to vidualize the conclusions more easily.

This Challenge contains a ReadMe file, the data sets, and the SQL Alchemy files.

Git Bash

I used GitBash to download the repository to my desktop and push and commit the changes made to the code into the repository

SQL Alchemy
This program was used to reflect tables, look into their data to run analysis and create graphs.
